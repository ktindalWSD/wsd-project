		<p><span>UGG strives to buy and sell quality guitars that have been previously owned</span>,
		but still in good enough shape to play without having to be repaired. We verify the state
		of the guitars before we sell them to you, our loyal customers, so that you can rest assured
		that you are getting a <strong>ready to rock</strong> instrument before you even buy it.</p>

		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p class="about_us">Used Guitars Galore got started because we had a dream of making a user-friendly site;
		one in which our customers could easily find virtually any type of guitar that they were 
		looking for. There were too many times that we went on a wild goose chase trying to track 
		down a special guitar that could almost never be found on any of the major guitar
		distributers' websites, or would be led to believe that as soon as you were ready to check
		out of a site, we found that the particular guitar that we wanted to buy was 'out of stock'.
		Well fear no more, loyal customer. You can push all doubts aside that we will not waste your
		time with unnecessary, time-consuming gallivantry searches. If we are displaying a
		particular guitar for sale, it is in stock and it is for sale. So, without anymore digression, 
		we leave you to your shopping and hope that you find everything you are looking for, and
		then some. If you have any questions or concerns whilst on your guitar purchasing quest, 
		please do not hesitate to contact us; you can reach us at the 'Contact Us' link at the top of 
		this page.
